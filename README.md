This is a really simple application that allows for communication between two different computers with Windows as the operational system through the Command Prompt. First, the server must be openned, and this will communicate the IP that the client needs to pass as an argument when openning the program. Doing that, both will be able to exchange messages, taking turns. 

The base for the program was the code at learn.microsoft.com I was using to study. I tweaked a few things, mainly creating some functions and what was happening at the end, since I wanted constant communication between both parts, and not something one-way only.
